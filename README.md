# Premier League Predictive Analysis

This project applies predictive modeling techniques to Premier League football match outcomes using Python and AutoML tools. It performs end-to-end data processing, model building, evaluation, and comparison to forecast match results based on historical data.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- Gathers match data from multiple seasons (team statistics, home/away, goals scored, etc.)
- Employs automated machine learning for feature selection and model optimization
- Compares various model types and visualizes performance metrics
- Aims to predict match results (win/draw/loss) using historical performance data

## ðŸ›  Key Components

- **Premierâ€‘Leagueâ€‘Predictiveâ€‘Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook showing:
  - Data loading, cleansing, and feature engineering
  - Exploratory data analysis with visualizations (graphs, seasonal trends)
  - Application of AutoML pipeline to train and evaluate models
  - Result comparison and performance summary
- **requirements.txt**: Listed Python dependencies for reproducibility

## ðŸŽ¯ Skills Demonstrated

- Data extraction and cleaning from sports datasets
- Feature engineering (team form, goal statistics, match conditions)
- Automated machine learning model training and tuning
- Classification tasks with evaluation metrics: accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix
- Data visualizationâ€”to highlight trends and model effectiveness
- Python scripting within Jupyter for reproducible analysis

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn, AutoML library (like`auto-sklearn`, `TPOT`, or similar)  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
